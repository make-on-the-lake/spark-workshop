## Goals

This workshop is about getting people familiar with the Spark Core so that they
can begin making their own IoT devices.  We want to provide attendees with

- Basic knowledge of how to send and retrieve date from the Spark Core
- Purchasing recommendations to help them come up with their own IoT ideas
- A basic understanding of how to hook sensors up to their Spark Core
- A resource for them to return to while continuing to work on their project
