# Welcome to Make on the Lake's<br/>Spark Workshop

This site will take you through the spark workshop.  During the workshop we will be learning how to:

- Connect our computers to our spark core
- Load code onto our spark
- Read data from the spark API (using javascript, ruby, or python)

So <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/steps/01-meet-the-spark-core.html">lets get started</a>!
