To connect to your spark using OSX we recommend using your terminal and the
Spark command line interface.

## Installing Spark CLI

To install the Spark CLI you will need node.js.

To test to see if you have node.js installed type

    node -v

into your terminal window and hit `ENTER`.  You will see output like

    v0.10.26

if node is installed.

We will be using the node package manager `npm` to install the Spark CLI.  To do
this simply type

    npm -g install spark-cli

into your terminal and press `ENTER`.  This `-g` flag in this command instructs
`npm` to install `spark-cli` as a global package.  This will give you access to the
`spark` command which we will be using to configure your Spark.

To verify your Spark CLI installation went swimmingly type

    spark

into your terminal window and press `ENTER`.  You should see some output about
the various commands similar to:
