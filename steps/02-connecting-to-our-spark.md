title:  Connecting to our Spark
---

Naturally the first step of the workshop will be connecting to your Spark Core.

## Documentation

The organizers will be available to assist you throughout the workshop so if you
are having trouble don't be afraid to ask for help.  However if you're checking
out this workshop at a later date or really really want to finish the workshop
all by yourself (<strong>not recommended</strong>) and you run into trouble
you can always checkout the documentation that the spark team has put together.

<strong>Every step of this workshop will start off links to the relevant
documentation</strong> over at
<a href="http://docs.spark.io" target="_blank">docs.spark.io</a>
so that you can easily reference it if you need it.

For connecting your Spark Core to WiFi that documentation is hosted over at:

- <a href="http://docs.spark.io/connect/" target="_blank">http://docs.spark.io/connect/</a>
