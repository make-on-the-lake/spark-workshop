Naturally the first step of the workshop will be connecting to your Spark Core.

## Documentation

The organizers will be available to assist you throughout the workshop so if you
are having trouble don't be afraid to ask for help.  However if you're checking
out this workshop at a later date or really really want to finish the workshop
all by yourself (<strong>not recommended</strong>) and you run into trouble
you can always checkout the documentation that the spark team has put together.

<strong>Every step of this workshop will start off links to the relevant
documentation</strong> over at
<a href="http://docs.spark.io" target="_blank">docs.spark.io</a>
so that you can easily reference it if you need it.

For connecting your Spark Core to WiFi that documentation is hosted over at:

- <a href="http://docs.spark.io/connect/" target="_blank">http://docs.spark.io/connect/</a>

## Plug in your Spark

To power your Spark plug your Spark into your computer using the USB cable in
your kit.  Once your spark in plugged in the LED should blink blue.  The LED
blinking blue means your spark is in <strong>listening mode</strong>.

### If Your Spark Does Not Boot Into Listening Mode

If your Spark does not boot into listening mode then simply hold the <strong>MODE</strong>
button down for <strong>3</strong> seconds while plugged in.  After that your
Spark's LED should blink blue.

## Signing Up For a Spark Account

We will all need Spark accounts to do much with our Sparks.  Of course if you
already have a spark account you can skip this step.  To sign up for an
account simply go to [https://build.spark.io/signup](https://build.spark.io/signup).

## Actually Connecting

Now that your Spark is plugged into your computer and in <strong>listening mode</strong>
we will begin setting up to communicate with it.

Depending on your operating system the steps to take to connect your core will differ.
