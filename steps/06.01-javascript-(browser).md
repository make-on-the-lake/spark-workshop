In this section we will use in browser JavaScript with jQuery to learn how to
read variables from our Spark Cores.

{% include api-docs.md %}

Also if you need help making requests from jQuery the relevant documentation
for `$.get` (the jQuery method we'll be using to retrieve data from the Spark
Cloud) can be found at:

- [https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/)

## List Devices

To list devices make a request to `https://api.spark.io/v1/devices` and provide
your access token as a `GET` variable.

    $.get('https://api.spark.io/v1/devices', { access_token: ACCESS_TOKEN })
      .then(function(res) {
        for (var i in res) {
          var device = res[i];
          console.log(device.name);
        }
      });

Here is an example response from this request

    [
      {
        "id": "53ff6f0650723",
        "name": "plumber_laser",
        "last_app": null,
        "last_heard": null,
        "connected": false
      }
    ]

## List Variables

You can also list the variables you have exposed on your Spark.  The URL for this
query is `https://api.spark.io/v1/devices/{DEVICE_ID}`.  Below is some sample code
making this request

    $.get('https://api.spark.io/v1/devices/' + DEVICE_ID, { access_token: ACCESS_TOKEN })
      .then(function(res) {
        console.log(res);
      });

    {
      id: "54ff6f066678554927290168",
      name: "test",
      connected: true,
      variables: {
        "my_var": "int32"
      },
      functions: [
        "digitalread",
        "digitalwrite",
        "analogread",
        "analogwrite"
      ],
      cc3000_patch_version: "1.29",
      last_heard: "2015-04-30T03:00:26.870Z"
    }

## Get Variable's Value

To actually get the value of a variable you make a request to
`https://api.spark.io/v1/devices/{DEVICE_ID}/{VARIABLE_NAME}`.  As you probably
expect by now example code is below

    $.get('https://api.spark.io/v1/devices/' + DEVICE_ID + '/' + VARIABLE_NAME, { access_token: ACCESS_TOKEN })
      .then(function(res) {
        console.log(res.name, res.result);
      });

And of course an example response from the above code:

    {
      cmd: "VarReturn",
      name: "test",
      result: 42,
      coreInfo: {
        last_app: "",
        last_heard: "2015-04-30T03:03:06.718Z",
        connected: true,
        last_handshake_at: "2015-04-30T03:02:34.107Z",
        deviceID: "54ff6f066678574927290167"
      }
    }

## Time To Hook Up A Sensor

Now that we can read variables from our Spark Core it's time to make those variables
interesting by hooking up a sensor.
